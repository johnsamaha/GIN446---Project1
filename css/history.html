                The World Wide Web, known as WWW, can be defined as an information system where documents and multimedia content are identified by Uniform Resource Locators (URL). These contents are interconnected through hyperlinks and accessed via the Internet by using software application known as web browsers
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_World_Wide_Web" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="Read [1.1] on Wikipedia" class="reference-link">[1.1]</a>
                (for e.g.: Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, Firefox, Opera, Safari…).
              </p>
              <p>
                Unlike the Internet, which is the global infrastructure of interconnected networks of computers and devices, the Web is a service that runs on top of it. This latter uses this network to access and share information through documents linked by hyperlinks.
              </p>
              <p>
                The history of the Web and browsers is central to the evolution of modern digital communication, marking significant technological milestones, as well as social milestones too.

            <h3 id="origin">Origins of the Web: Where the Web was born</h3>
            <p>
              A British scientist invented the WWW in 1989, while working at the CERN (Conseil Européen pour la Recherche Nucléaire). Sir Tim Berners-Lee proposed a system for managing and linking scientific information across computers. Having a large and extended community, the CERN includes more than 17000 scientists from over 100 countries

              working each nationally in their home countries; this Web was conceived and developed to meet the demand for automated information-sharing in universities and institutes around the world. Tim Berners-Lee introduced fundamental technologies such as Hypertext Markup Language (HTML), Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP), and in 1990, the first graphical Browser WorldWideWeb (renamed Nexus).

            <h3 id="war">Early Browser Wars</h3>
            <p>
              The National Center for Supercomputing Applications (NCSA) developed Mosaic. It was released in 1993 and was considered a turning point. Unlike earlier browsers, Mosaic allowed inline images to be displayed alongside text, greatly improving usability and attracting mainstream attention
              <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_web_browser" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="Read [1.3] on Wikipedia" class="reference-link">[1.3]</a>,

            </p>
            <p>
              The success of Mosaic inspired the creation of Netscape Navigator in 1994, which quickly became the most popular browser due to its speed and user-friendly interface
              <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_web_browser" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="Read [1.3] on Wikipedia" class="reference-link">[1.3]</a>.
              This period triggered the first browser wars, between Netscape and Microsoft Internet Explorer. Consequently, Microsoft bundled Internet Explorer with its Windows operating system starting in 1995, giving it a significant advantage and eventual dominance by the 2000s
              <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Browser_wars" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="Read [1.5] on Wikipedia" class="reference-link">[1.5]</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
              Unable to compete with Microsoft’s aggressive distribution strategy, Netscape chose to release its source to the public. The open-source movement led to the creation of Mozilla Firefox in 2004, while Apple’s Safari launched in 2003 and Google Chrome was released in 2008, becoming a major player. Nowadays, these modern browsers are the primary tools for internet access.

            <p>Browsers notably emerged during the late 1990s and early 2000s.</p>
            <p>
              Opera (1996) was recognized for its innovative features such as tabbed browsing and integrated search
              <a href="https://www.devzery.com/post/guide-to-browsers-history" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="Read [1.4] on Devzery" class="reference-link">[1.4]</a>.
              Apple’s Safari (2003) optimized browsing within the Mac ecosystem. However, the most disruptive change came in 2008, when Google Chrome was launched; it emphasized speed, minimal design, and strong integration with Google Services, quickly surpassing its competitors in the market
              <a href="https://www.devzery.com/post/guide-to-browsers-history" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="Read [1.4] on Devzery" class="reference-link">[1.4]</a>,

            </p>
            <p>
              Technologically, this period marked a shift towards open web standards. HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript APIs enabled rich, interactive applications to run natively in browsers without external plugins like Flash or Java. Moreover, browsers began supporting WebGL for 3D graphics and adopting advanced JavaScript engines for performance

            <h3 id="trends">Trends and the Future</h3>
            <p>
              Browsers are beyond tools for viewing websites. They have evolved into advanced platforms enabling more complex applications such as video conferencing, gaming, and cloud-based productivity tools. Trends emphasize privacy protection (e.g., blocking trackers, incognito browsing mode), cross-device synchronization, and progressive web apps (PWAs) that blur the line between native and web applications
              <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/tech/annals-of-technology/the-evolution-of-the-web-in-a-blink" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="Read [1.7] on New Yorker" class="reference-link">[1.7]</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
              Looking forward, experts foresee browsers incorporating Artificial Intelligence (AI) to provide more personalized recommendations, voice-enabled navigation, and automated content curation. Additionally, decentralization efforts, such as the Solid project by Tim Berners-Lee, aim to return data ownership to users (allow users to have full control of their own data), reducing reliance on centralized platforms
              <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/tim-berners-lee" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="Read [1.8] on Wired" class="reference-link">[1.8]</a>.
              The future of browsers will likely balance innovation, user privacy, and accessibility.

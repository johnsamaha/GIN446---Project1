              <summary><strong>Is there a newer version than HTML 5.2?</strong></summary>
              <br>
              <p>No official version beyond HTML 5.2 has been published as a W3C (World Wide Web Consortium) Recommendation. Instead, "HTML continues to be developed as a 'living standard' maintained by the WHATWG, meaning it evolves continuously" (rather than using numbered releases) <a href="https://html.spec.whatwg.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="Read [R1.1] on WHATWG" class="reference-link">[R1.1]</a>.</p>
              <p>"HTML 5.2 was published as a W3C Recommendation on 14 December 2017 and represents the second minor revision of the HTML5 core language" <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/2017/REC-html52-20171214/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="Read [R1.2] on W3C" class="reference-link">[R1.2]</a>. After that, W3C also explored HTML 5.3 as a draft, but it never became a formal, stable version. In fact, as of 28 January 2021, "the W3C retired the numbered HTML versions (including 5.2 and the draft of 5.3) in favor of a consolidated, evolving specification" <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML5" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="Read [R1.3] on Wikipedia" class="reference-link">[R1.3]</a>.</p>
              <p>The modern HTML specification is now the HTML Living Standard, maintained by WHATWG (Web Hypertext Application Technology Working Group). "This living standard is not versioned; instead, changes, new features, and corrections are continuously integrated over time" <a href="https://html.spec.whatwg.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="Read [R1.1] on WHATWG" class="reference-link">[R1.1]</a>. The WHATWG's spec is simply called "HTML" (without version numbers). It is considered "the authoritative source for current HTML behaviors and APIs" <a href="https://html.spec.whatwg.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="Read [R1.1] on WHATWG" class="reference-link">[R1.1]</a>.</p>
              <p>Therefore, while historically we speak of HTML 5.0, 5.1, 5.2, etc., in practice the development has moved away from versioned releases. New features might be added, deprecated ones removed, and the spec evolves. But there is no newer "HTML 5.3" or "HTML 6.0" as a formal standard.</p>

              <br>
              <p>CSS includes special statements called at-rules (because they begin with @). These rules provide instructions beyond standard selectors, allowing developers to import stylesheets, define responsive layouts, load custom fonts, or specify conditional styling. Common at-rules include @import, @media, @font-face, @keyframes, and @supports <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_syntax/At-rule" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="Read [R2.1] on MDN Web Docs" class="reference-link">[R2.1]</a>.</p>

              <ul>
                <li>@import: Allows one stylesheet to include another.</li>
                <li>@media: Applies styles conditionally based on media queries, such as screen width, orientation, or resolution. It is central to responsive web design.</li>
                <li>@font-face: Load custom fonts with which to display text.</li> 
                <li>@keyframes: Control animation steps by defining styles for points along the animation sequence.</li>

              <summary><strong>Can URLs include non-Latin characters?</strong></summary>
              <br>
              <p>Modern URLs can include non-Latin characters in certain parts, thanks to two key standards: Internationalized Domain Names (IDNs) for the domain part, and Internationalized Resource Identifiers (IRIs) for path/query parts. Under the hood they are converted into an ASCII-compatible form so that legacy Internet infrastructure still works <a href=" https://www.w3.org/International/articles/idn-and-iri/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="Read [R3.1] on W3.org" class="reference-link">[R3.1]</a>, <a href=" https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internationalized_Resource_Identifier " target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="Read [R3.2] on wikipedia" class="reference-link">[R3.2]</a>.</p>
              <p>Originally the Domain Name System (DNS) only allowed host names to use the ASCII subset (Latin letters A-Z, digits, hyphen) because of early networking protocol constraints. Non-Latin alphabets (e.g., Arabic, Cyrillic, Chinese) were not supported. This posed a barrier for non-Latin-script users worldwide <a href=" https://www.w3.org/International/articles/idn-and-iri/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="Read [R3.1] on W3.org" class="reference-link">[R3.1]</a>.</p>
              <p>To address this, the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) developed the IDNA (Internationalized Domain Names in Applications) standard. With it, domain labels containing Unicode characters are first processed (normalization, mapping) and then encoded via an ASCII-compatible encoding system called Punycode, prefixed by <code>xn--</code> so that DNS can handle them <a href=" https://www.ionos.com/digitalguide/domains/domain-administration/punycode " target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="Read [R3.3] on Ionos" class="reference-link">[R3.3]</a>, <a href=" https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/main/docs/idn.md" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="Read [R3.4] on Chromium Project" class="reference-link">[R3.4]</a>. For example, the domain <code>münchen.de</code> becomes <code>xn--mnchen-3ya.de</code> behind the scenes <a href=" https://www.ionos.com/digitalguide/domains/domain-administration/punycode " target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="Read [R3.3] on Ionos" class="reference-link">[R3.3]</a>.</p>
              <p>On the resource side (paths, query strings) the IRI standard extends the Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) by allowing Unicode characters. When a browser sends a request on the wire, these Unicode parts are typically UTF-8 encoded and then percent-escaped, so they comply with the ASCII-based URI syntax <a href=" https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internationalized_Resource_Identifier " target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="Read [R3.2] on wikipedia" class="reference-link">[R3.2]</a>.</p>
              <p>When you enter a URL containing non-Latin characters, the user agent (browser) usually converts each domain label into its Punycode ASCII representation, then submits that to the DNS. The display in the address bar might still show the original script (depending on browser policy and security concerns) or fall back to the Punycode form if the domain is considered risky <a href=" https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/main/docs/idn.md" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="Read [R3.4] on Chromium Project" class="reference-link">[R3.4]</a>.</p>
              <p>One important point: Not all uses of non-Latin characters are permitted. Registries often restrict scripts or character sets to avoid confusion (homograph attacks) where characters from different scripts look visually identical (for example Cyrillic “а” vs Latin “a”) <a href=" https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punycode" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="Read [R3.5] on wikipedia" class="reference-link">[R3.5]</a>.</p>

              <summary><strong>JavaScript History</strong></summary>
              <br>
              <p>JavaScript was created in 1995 by Brendan Eich at Netscape Communications. Originally developed in just 10 days, it was designed to make web pages more interactive and dynamic. Over the years, it evolved from a simple browser scripting tool into one of the most important and widely used programming languages on the web <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="Read [R4.1] on MDN Web Docs Mozilla" class="reference-link">[R4.1]</a>.</p>
              <p>Explanation & Evolution</p>
              <p>In the mid-1990s, the early web was largely static — HTML could only define structure, and CSS was still in its infancy. Netscape wanted a lightweight scripting language to add interactivity to its browser, Netscape Navigator. Brendan Eich created the first version, initially called Mocha, which was later renamed LiveScript, and finally JavaScript for marketing reasons — to associate it with the popularity of Java at the time <a href="https://brendaneich.com/2010/07/a-brief-history-of-javascript/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="Read [R4.2] on Brendan Eich’s Blog" class="reference-link">[R4.2]</a>.</p>
              <p>In 1996, Microsoft implemented a similar version of JavaScript in Internet Explorer, calling it JScript, which led to compatibility issues between browsers. To standardize the language, Netscape submitted JavaScript to ECMA International, resulting in the ECMAScript standard (ECMA-262) released in 1997. ECMAScript remains the official name for the language specification, while “JavaScript” is its popular implementation <a href="https://ecma-international.org/publications-and-standards/standards/ecma-262/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="Read [R4.3] on ECMA International" class="reference-link">[R4.3]</a>.</p>
              <p>Subsequent versions improved syntax, performance, and developer tools:
                <ul>
                  <li>ES3 (1999) standardized core features used across browsers.</li>
                  <li>ES5 (2009) added JSON support and strict mode.</li>
                  <li>ES6 / ES2015 (2015) was a major update introducing let, const, classes, modules, and arrow functions.li>
                  <li>Later editions continue to evolve annually, adding features such as async/await, optional chaining, and new data structures <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="Read [R4.4] on MDN Web Docs Mozilla" class="reference-link">[R4.4]</a>.</li>
                </ul>
              </p>
              <p>Today, JavaScript powers not only web browsers but also servers (Node.js), desktop apps (Electron), and mobile apps (React Native). It remains one of the most influential and versatile languages in modern computing.</p>

              <summary><strong>Does JavaScript Support Pre and Post Incrementation?</strong></summary>
              <br>
              <p>JavaScript supports both pre-incrementation (<code>++x</code>) and post-incrementation (<code>x++</code>) operators. Both increase a variable’s value by one, but they differ in when the increment happens relative to the expression’s evaluation <a href=" https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Increment" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="Read [R5.1] on Web Docs Mozilla" class="reference-link">[R5.1]</a>.</p>
              <p>Explanation <a href=" https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_operators.asp " target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="Read [R5.2] on W3Schools" class="reference-link">[R5.2]</a>:</p>
                <p>The increment operator (++) is one of JavaScript’s unary operators, meaning it acts on a single operand. 
                  <ul>
                      <li>Pre-increment (<code>++x</code>): The variable <code>x</code> is incremented first, and the new value is immediately returned by the expression.</li>
                      <li>Post-increment (<code>x++</code>): The current value of <code>x</code> is returned first, and the increment happens after the expression is evaluated.</li>
                  </ul>
                </p>
                <p>Examples:</p>
                <p><pre>
let x = 5;
console.log(++x); // Output: 6 (pre-increment: value increased before use)
console.log(x++); // Output: 6 (post-increment: value increased after use)
console.log(x);   // Output: 7
</pre>
</p>
<p>In the above example:</p>
<p>
  <ul>
    <li>The first <code>console.log(++x)</code> increments <code>x</code> to 6 before printing.</li>
    <li>The second <code>console.log(x++)</code> prints 6 but increments afterward, making <code>x=7</code> by the end.</li>
  </ul>
</p>
<p>This distinction becomes important in loops and complex expressions. Using pre-increment can be slightly more predictable when you want to use the incremented value immediately, while post-increment is common in counters or <code>for</code> loops (e.g., <code>for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++)</code>) <a href=" https://javascript.info/operators#increment-decrement  " target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="Read [R5.3] on JavaScript Info" class="reference-link">[R5.3]</a>.</p>
<p>JavaScript also supports pre- and post-decrement (<code>--x</code> and <code>x--</code>) with similar rules — they decrease a variable’s value by one before or after evaluation respectively <a href=" https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Increment" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="Read [R5.1] on Web Docs Mozilla" class="reference-link">[R5.1]</a>.</p>

  <details>
    <summary><strong>What Does JavaScript’s <code>eval()</code> Function Do?</strong></summary>
    <br>

    <p>
      The <code>eval()</code> method in JavaScript takes a string as its argument and executes it as code 
      in the current execution context 
      <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/eval" 
         target="_blank" rel="noopener" 
         title="Read [R6.1] on MDN Web Docs Mozilla" class="reference-link">[R6.1]</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
      In JavaScript (ECMAScript), <code>eval()</code> is a global function (a property of the global object) 
      that accepts a string. If the string contains an expression, <code>eval()</code> evaluates it and returns 
      its value; if it contains statements, they are executed. For example:
    </p>

    <pre><code>
let x = 2;
let result = eval("3 * x + 1"); // result is 7
    </code></pre>

    <p>
      However, using <code>eval()</code> is generally discouraged for both security and performance reasons: 
      it can execute arbitrary code, bypasses engine optimizations, and is usually unnecessary since features 
      like <code>JSON.parse()</code>, <code>Function()</code>, or dynamic imports provide safer alternatives

    <summary><strong>What Are Regular Expressions and How Do They Work in JavaScript and Python?</strong></summary>
    <br>

    <p>
      Regular expressions (regex) are patterns that describe sets of strings. 
      They are used for searching, matching, and manipulating text. 
      Both JavaScript and Python include built-in regex support, though their APIs and syntax differ 
      <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Regular_expressions"

         title="Read [R7.1] on MDN Web Docs Mozilla"
         class="reference-link">[R7.1]</a>.
    </p>

    <p><strong>How They Work in JavaScript</strong></p>

    <p>
      A regular expression is a sequence of characters forming a search pattern.  
      In JavaScript, regexes are objects created using either regex literals 
      (e.g., <code>/abc/</code>) or the <code>RegExp</code> constructor.  
      They interact with methods such as <code>test()</code>, <code>exec()</code>, 
      <code>match()</code>, and <code>replace()</code> 
      <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Regular_expressions"

         title="Read [R7.1] on MDN Web Docs Mozilla"
         class="reference-link">[R7.1]</a>.
    </p>

    <p><strong>How They Work in Python</strong></p>

    <p>
      In Python, the <code>re</code> module provides regex functionality.  
      It includes functions like <code>re.match()</code>, <code>re.search()</code>, 
      <code>re.findall()</code>, and allows compiling patterns into regex objects 
      for repeated use

         title="Read [R7.2] on Python Documentation"
         class="reference-link">[R7.2]</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
      Under the hood, modern regex engines compile patterns into byte-code or finite automata, 
      and often rely on backtracking algorithms to match patterns efficiently

      In PHP, the <code>foreach ($array as $value)</code> syntax assigns each element’s value to 
      <code>$value</code> by value (a copy). To modify the original array element, you must use 
      <code>foreach ($array as &amp;$value)</code>

      In Python, <code>for item in list:</code> gives <code>item</code> a reference to the value; 
      if the value is mutable (like a list), you can mutate it. 
      But reassigning <code>item</code> (e.g., <code>item = …</code>) only changes the loop variable, not the list. 
      Modifying the list by index (e.g., <code>list[i] = …</code>) changes the original

    <summary><strong>How much water does mining or a single “Thank You” message to ChatGPT cost?</strong></summary>
    <br>

    <p>
      Mining (especially of data centres and AI infrastructure) uses substantial water for cooling and operations. 
      For a single prompt to ChatGPT, estimates suggest only a few drops of water 
      <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/685045/sam-altman-average-chatgpt-energy-water"
         target="_blank" rel="noopener"
         title="Read [R9.1] on The Verge" class="reference-link">[R9.1]</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
      Large data centres that power AI and mining operations consume enormous amounts of water for cooling. 
      For example, a U.S. data centre may consume millions of gallons per day 
      <a href="https://www.eesi.org/articles/view/data-centers-and-water-consumption"
         target="_blank" rel="noopener"
         title="Read [R9.2] on EESI" class="reference-link">[R9.2]</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
      For ChatGPT queries, recent statements indicate each query uses approximately 
      <strong>0.000085 gallons of water</strong> (about one-fifteenth of a teaspoon) 
      and about <strong>0.34 Wh</strong> of energy 
      <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/685045/sam-altman-average-chatgpt-energy-water"
         target="_blank" rel="noopener"
         title="Read [R9.1] on The Verge" class="reference-link">[R9.1]</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
      While the water cost for a single “thank you” message is minimal, the cumulative environmental footprint 
      across millions of queries becomes non-trivial. This underscores why energy &amp; cooling efficiency 
      is important in data-intensive computing tasks.

    <summary><strong>What is Local Storage in Web Browsers?</strong></summary>
    <br>

    <p>
      Local Storage is a Web API provided by browsers which allows web applications to store key-value data 
      on the client side that persists across sessions 
      <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/localStorage"
         target="_blank" rel="noopener"
         title="Read [R10.1] on MDN Web Docs Mozilla" class="reference-link">[R10.1]</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
      Introduced with HTML5, the Web Storage API includes <code>localStorage</code> and 
      <code>sessionStorage</code>. <code>localStorage</code> allows storing data persistently across browser 
      sessions, and the data remains until explicitly removed. It is synchronous and limited in size 
      (typically ~5 MB per origin) 
      <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/localStorage"
         target="_blank" rel="noopener"
         title="Read [R10.1] on MDN Web Docs Mozilla" class="reference-link">[R10.1]</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
      Unlike cookies, data stored in <code>localStorage</code> is not sent with each HTTP request, which 
      improves performance. Developers often use it for storing user preferences, caching small data sets, 
      or offline web app state

    <summary><strong>How Do Websites Keep Your Passwords Secure?</strong></summary>
    <br>

    <p>
      Websites protect passwords by never storing them as plain text; instead they store hashes (and salts) 
      using secure hashing algorithms. Secure communication (HTTPS) and proper server configuration also 
      play key roles 
      <a href="https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Password_Storage_Cheat_Sheet.html"
         target="_blank" rel="noopener"
         title="Read [R11.1] on OWASP" class="reference-link">[R11.1]</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
      When you enter a password, the website typically takes that password, applies a cryptographic hash 
      (often salted and iterated) and stores the resulting hash in its database. During login, the user’s 
      password is hashed the same way and compared. This means even if the database is breached, attackers 
      cannot easily recover the original passwords 
      <a href="https://www.kaspersky.com/blog/how-to-store-passwords/49101/"
         target="_blank" rel="noopener"
         title="Read [R11.2] on Kaspersky" class="reference-link">[R11.2]</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
      Modern guidance (e.g., from OWASP) recommends using slow hashing algorithms (e.g., bcrypt, Argon2), 
      generating per-user salts, and securing the entire stack (HTTPS, server hardening)

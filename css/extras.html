        <summary><strong>Is there a newer version than HTML 5.2?</strong></summary>
        <p>No official version beyond HTML 5.2 has been published as a W3C (World Wide Web Consortium) Recommendation. Instead, “HTML continues to be developed as a “living standard” maintained by the WHATWG, meaning it evolves continuously” (rather than using numbered releases) <a href="https://html.spec.whatwg.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="Read [R1.1] on WHATWG">[R1.1]</a>.</p>
        <p>“HTML 5.2 was published as a W3C Recommendation on 14 December 2017 and represents the second minor revision of the HTML5 core language” <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/2017/REC-html52-20171214/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="Read [R1.2] on W3C">[R1.2]</a>. After that, W3C also explored HTML 5.3 as a draft, but it never became a formal, stable version. In fact, as of 28 January 2021, “the W3C retired the numbered HTML versions (including 5.2 and the draft of 5.3) in favor of a consolidated, evolving specification” <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML5" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="Read [R1.3] on Wikipedia">[R1.3]</a>.</p>
        <p>The modern HTML specification is now the HTML Living Standard, maintained by WHATWG (Web Hypertext Application Technology Working Group). “This living standard is not versioned; instead, changes, new features, and corrections are continuously integrated over time” <a href="https://html.spec.whatwg.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="Read [R1.1] on WHATWG">[R1.1]</a>. The WHATWG’s spec is simply called “HTML” (without version numbers). It is considered “the authoritative source for current HTML behaviors and APIs” <a href="https://html.spec.whatwg.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="Read [R1.1] on WHATWG">[R1.1]</a>.</p>
        <p>Therefore, while historically we speak of HTML 5.0, 5.1, 5.2, etc., in practice the development has moved away from versioned releases. New features might be added, deprecated ones removed, and the spec evolves. But there is no newer “HTML 5.3” or “HTML 6.0” as a formal standard.</p>

        <summary><strong>What are the CSS Rules?</strong></summary>
        <p>CSS includes special statements called at-rules (because the begin with @). These rules provide instructions beyond standard selectors, allowing developers to import stylesheets, define responsive layouts, load custom font, or specify conditional styling. Common at-rules include @import, @media, @font-face, @keyframes, and @supports <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_syntax/At-rule" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="Read [R2.1] on MDN Web Docs">[R2.1]</a>.</p>
        <p>Examples <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css_ref_atrules.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="Read [R2.2] on W3Schools">[R2.2]</a>:
            <ul>
            <li>@import: Allows one stylesheet to include another.</li>
            <li>@media: Applies styles conditionally based on media queries, such as screen width, orientation, or resolution. It is central to responsive web design.</li>
            <li>@font-face: Load custom fonts with which to display text.</li> 
            <li>@keyframes: Control animation steps by defining styles for points along the animation sequence.</li>
            <li>@supports: Apply styles only if the browser supports a CSS feature.</li>
            <li>@layer: Used to control how the CSS cascade layers evaluates the order of styles.</li>
            <li>@page: Customizes the dimension, orientation, and margins of printed pages.</li> 
            <li>@font-palette-values: Allows you to customize the default values of a font-palette.</li>
</ul>

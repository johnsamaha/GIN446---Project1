          <section class="card article-section" aria-labelledby="introduction">
            <h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>
            <p>The Internet can be defined as a global system of interconnected computer networks that communicate using Internet Protocols (IP).</p>
            <p>Web security involves a combination of technologies, protocols, and practices designed to protect websites, web applications, servers, and online data from internet-based cyberattacks like malware, phishing, and data breaches. These threats may compromise data confidentiality, integrity, or availability <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_security" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="Read [2.1] on Wikipedia" class="reference-link">[2.1]</a>.</p>
            <p>As reliance on digital services grows, web security has become a critical concern for individuals, businesses, and governments worldwide.</p>

          <!-- Common Risks -->
          <section class="card article-section" aria-labelledby="risks">
            <h3 id="risks">Common Risks on the Web</h3>
            <p>One of the most significant risks is malware, a general term for malicious software such as viruses, worms, and ransomware. This malicious software infiltrates systems to cause damage or steal information <a href="https://www.kaspersky.com/resource-center/threats/malware" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="Read [2.2] on Kaspersky" class="reference-link">[2.2]</a>. Attackers often use techniques like phishing, where deceptive emails or websites trick users into revealing sensitive information such as passwords or financial details <a href="https://www.cisa.gov/topics/cybersecurity-best-practices" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="Read [2.3] on CISA" class="reference-link">[2.3]</a>.</p>
            <p>Another type of threat is the Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack, where attackers overwhelm a website or server with excessive traffic, making it unavailable to legitimate users <a href="https://www.kaspersky.com/resource-center/threats/malware" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="Read [2.2] on Kaspersky" class="reference-link">[2.2]</a>. Similarly, web application vulnerabilities such as SQL injection and cross-site scripting (XSS) allow attackers to manipulate databases or inject malicious code into web pages <a href="https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="Read [2.4] on OWASP" class="reference-link">[2.4]</a>.</p>
            <p>Data privacy is at risk through man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks, where an attacker intercepts communication between a user and a website, capturing login credentials or sensitive data <a href="https://www.cisa.gov/topics/cybersecurity-best-practices" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="Read [2.3] on CISA" class="reference-link">[2.3]</a>. As the Internet of Things (IoT) expands, poorly secured devices further increase the attack surface <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/sensor-cybersecurity-standards" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="Read [2.5] on IEEE Spectrum" class="reference-link">[2.5]</a>.</p>

          <!-- Safe Practices -->
          <section class="card article-section" aria-labelledby="safe">
            <h3 id="safe">Safe Practices for Users and Organizations</h3>
            <p>To counter these risks, users and organizations must adopt security practices.</p>
            <p>Individuals must always use strong and unique passwords; it is an essential measure. A strong password typically contains a mix of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters, and should never be reused across services <a href="https://www.kaspersky.com/resource-center/threats/malware" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="Read [2.2] on Kaspersky" class="reference-link">[2.2]</a>. Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA), which requires additional verification beyond a password, provides another layer of defense.</p>
            <p>Organizations should prioritize Secure Socket Layer / Transport Layer Security (SSL/TLS) encryption to protect transmitted data between users and servers <a href="https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="Read [2.4] on OWASP" class="reference-link">[2.4]</a>. SSL/TLS are cryptographic protocols that provide security for internet communications by encrypting data between a client and a server, ensuring privacy, authenticity, and data integrity.</p>
            <p>Regular software updates and patches are critical in closing vulnerabilities that attackers might exploit. Firewalls and intrusion detection systems help monitor and block suspicious activities on networks.</p>
            <p>Education and awareness also play a key role. Employees and students trained in recognizing phishing attempts and suspicious links are less likely to fall victim to attacks <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/sensor-cybersecurity-standards" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="Read [2.5] on IEEE Spectrum" class="reference-link">[2.5]</a>. Adopting the principle of least privilege, limiting user access rights to only what is necessary, reduces the potential impact of compromised accounts.</p>

          <!-- Emerging Trends -->
          <section class="card article-section" aria-labelledby="trends">
            <h3 id="trends">Emerging Trends in Web Security</h3>
            <p>Zero Trust Architecture (ZTA) has emerged as a leading security model. Unlike traditional defenses, ZTA assumes that no user or device is inherently trustworthy and continuously verifies identity and access privileges <a href="https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/sp/800-207/final" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="Read [2.6] on NIST" class="reference-link">[2.6]</a>.</p>
            <p>Additionally, the growing use of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning allows security systems to detect anomalies and respond to threats in real time <a href="https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/sp/800-207/final" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="Read [2.6] on NIST" class="reference-link">[2.6]</a>.</p>
            <p>The rise of cloud computing also requires enhanced web security strategies. Cloud providers and clients must collaborate to ensure secure configurations, compliance with regulations such as GDPR, and robust data backup mechanisms <a href="https://www.enisa.europa.eu/sites/default/files/all_files/ENISA%20-%20Cloud%20Computing%20-%20final.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="Read [2.7] on ENISA" class="reference-link">[2.7]</a>.</p>

          <!-- Conclusion -->
          <section class="card article-section" aria-labelledby="conclusion">
            <h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
            <p>Web security is a continuously evolving challenge. As new technologies and services expand the digital ecosystem, attackers also develop more advanced techniques. Protecting users and data requires a layered approach that combines technical safeguards, user education, and proactive policy development. Ultimately, maintaining a secure web environment is not a one-time effort but an ongoing process of vigilance and adaptation.</p>

                <p>In the Middle East, internet adoption varies, but digital adoption is generally high, especially in countries like UAE and Qatar. Lebanon, while having a high percentage of its population using the internet (over 80% in 2023), people struggle with slow and expensive internet services, with average fixed broadband speeds below 10Mbps and a reliance on slower, more costly mobile data. <a href="https://smex.org/what-are-the-critical-gaps-in-lebanons-internet-infrastructure" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="Read [4.1] on SMEX">[4.1]</a></p>
                <p>To understand the digital landscape, it is useful to define some key terms:</p>
                 <ul>
                    <li>Internet penetration is the percentage of a country’s population that uses internet.</li>
                    <li>Fixed broadband is the high-speed internet that is delivered through fixed lines (for e.g.: DSL, fiber, cable).</li>
                    <li>Mobile Internet is the internet accessed via cellular networks (3G, 4G, 5G).</li>
                </ul>
            </section>

             <section aria-labelledby="Adoption">
                <h3 id="Adoption"> Internet and Mobile Adoption in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA).</h3>
                <p>According to GSMA Intelligence, at the end of 2023, around 427 million people in MENA subscribed to a mobile service, representing about 64% of the population. Of those, around 49% were using mobile internet, which represents nearly 327 million people. Mobile internet use in the region has tripled over the past 10 years <a href="https://event-assets.gsma.com/pdf/181124-Mobile-Economy-MENA-2024.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="Read [4.2] PDF on GSMA">[4.2]</a>.</p>
                <p>On the fixed broadband side, while adoption is growing, many countries still lag behind due to infrastructure, costs, and policy challenges. The broadband index report for the MEA area shows that the 4G is dominant and that the 5G adoption is rising, but unevenly (5G is limited, less than 1% of users have access to 5G technology, indicating a reliance on older infrastructure)<a href="https://www.nokia.com/sites/default/files/2023-05/mea-broadband-index_may_2023.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="Read [4.3] PDF on Nokia">[4.3]</a>, <a href="https://smex.org/what-are-the-critical-gaps-in-lebanons-internet-infrastructure" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="Read [4.1] on SMEX">[4.1]</a>.</p>

                <h3 id="Usage"> Lebanon’s Recent figures on Internet Usage and Connectivity.</h3>
                <p>At the start of 2024, there were 4.76 million internet users in Lebanon. Internet penetration was approximately 90.1% of the population based on <a href="https://datareportal.com/reports/digital-2024-lebanon" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="Read [4.4] on DataReportal">[4.4]</a>. And by early 2025, this rose up to 5.34 million users, with penetration at 91.6% as stated in <a href="https://datareportal.com/reports/digital-2025-lebanon" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="Read [4.5] on DataReportal">[4.5]</a>. Also <a href="https://datareportal.com/reports/digital-2025-lebanon" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="Read [4.5] on DataReportal">[4.5]</a> describes that the number of active cellular mobile connections was around 4.68 million in early 2025, equivalent to 80.4% of the population.</p>
                <p>Lebanon’s broadband speed ranking is relatively low globally. In 2024, Lebanon was ranked 196<sup>th</sup> worldwide with a mean broadband download speed of 9.67 Mbps <a href="https://economics.creditlibanais.com/Article/212232" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="Read [4.6] on Credit Libanais">[4.6]</a>
. It is stated in <a href="https://www.internetsociety.org/news/press-releases/2024/challenges-and-recommendations-for-internet-connectivity-in-the-middle-east" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="Read [4.7] on Internet Society">[4.7]</a> that the mobile internet median download speed is about 30.20 Mbps in January 2025 (a slight decline from 2024), and that the fixed broadband internet media download speed is approximately 18.78 Mbps in early 2025 (which is a strong improvement over 2024).  </p>

                <h3 id="Trends">Comparative Trends and Challenges</h3>
                <p>Lebanon’s level of internet penetration is high compared to many countries in the MENA region, but surpassing many literacy and infrastructure hurdles. However, fixed broadband speeds are modest, and local content hosting remains limited, increasing latency and dependency on international infrastructure. The growth rate in mobile connections has slowed a bit (or grown incrementally) while broadband speeds, especially fixed broadband, have improved (notably approximately 36% year-over-year in median fixed speeds) <a href="https://datareportal.com/reports/digital-2025-lebanon" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="Read [4.5] on DataReportal">[4.5]</a>, <a href="https://economics.creditlibanais.com/Article/212232" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="Read [4.6] on Credit Libanais">[4.6]</a>
.</p>
                <p>In the MENA region overall, while mobile internet adoption is strong and increasing, a significant usage gap remains. Many people are covered by networks but do not subscribe or meaningfully use mobile internet due to cost, device availability, digital literacy… <a href="https://event-assets.gsma.com/pdf/181124-Mobile-Economy-MENA-2024.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="Read [4.2] PDF on GSMA">[4.2]</a>, <a href="https://www.internetsociety.org/news/press-releases/2024/challenges-and-recommendations-for-internet-connectivity-in-the-middle-east" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="Read [4.7] on Internet Society">[4.7]</a>.</p>
                <p>So, in summary, the Lebanese people are facing the following challenges: outdated infrastructure, high costs, low local content hosted, and security due to a low score in cybersecurity and potential vulnerabilities.</p>

                <p>Based on Statista, internet penetration in Lebanon was projected to be 82.49% in 2025, the number of internet users is predicted to be 4.83 million, and 100% 4G and 3G network coverage. And in terms of the wider Middle East, Statista also shows a high internet penetration, which varies by country, with UAE having a very high penetration rate (90.96% in 2025)</p>

            <h3 id="Conclusion"></h3>
            <p>In conclusion, Lebanon has achieved high levels of internet adoption, with over 90% of people using the internet, and steady growth in users. Mobile internet speeds are relatively good, and fixed broadband speeds are improving, but still lag what many developed countries offer. Key challenges include improving local hosting infrastructure (increasing usage and content localization), expanding fixed broadband performance more uniformly, and closing the usage/access gaps (cost, device availability).   </p>
